<div class="entry-content"><blockquote>“It is not required that we know all of the details about every stretch of the river. Indeed, were we to know, it would not be an adventure, and I wonder if there would be much point in the journey.” 
― Jeffrey R. Anderson</blockquote>




<p>The other day I was helping my mom find her contacts on outlook.com, Microsoft’s confusing attempt to rename their purchased Hotmail.com. As I explained to her step-by-step how to do this, she stopped me so she could go get her notepad to write down how to do it.</p>


<p>“Ok, start again from the beginning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wait- I don’t remember even once doing this at a computer. I don’t think I’ve ever written down the steps on how to get somewhere on the web after somebody’s told me where to go and how to get there. Why is it then that my mom has to? Maybe it’s because I grew up with computers and have been using them for so long I’m just “good” at it by now and can find my own way through easily enough as long as someone (or some icon) points me in the right direction. While that may be true that I’m more accustomed to general internet symbology or whatever you want to call standard internet navigational layouts, I really believe that there’s a fundamental difference between the way my mother perceives websites and the way I perceive them. (outcome of prolonged use can remember 10000 steps)</p>




<p>To most people who don’t use the computers very often, a computer is just a machine in which a specified list of steps will result in an expected outcome. While this is almost the purest definition of what a computer should do, they are not looking at their interactions with computers as most everyday computer users or “power users” do.</p>


<p></p>

<p>A power user often has no idea what their intended use for the computer is when they start it up. Most settle into a comfortable routine of checking email, facebook twitter, etc. before moving on to other work. A non-power user will almost assuredly have a very distinct purpose for using the computer in mind before they go to turn on the machine. As they flip the switch they start thinking immediately about how to get the desired result from the machine, sometimes thinking very far ahead in terms of their plan of action.</p>


<p>A non-power user turns their interaction with the computer into a program itself which, when met with changing user interfaces, naming conventions or iconography, throws an error that usually results in a power user taking the helm for them and explaining, step-by-step, how to achieve the non-power user’s goal. This detailed process essentially trains the non-power user on how to accomplish the task for next time, as long as nothing in the “program” changes. The problem is that it inevitably will.</p>


<p>So what makes power users able to overcome these changes? How come my mom can’t always remember how to get to her email but I can remember how to use hundred if not thousands of websites, each with their own quirks and interfaces?</p>


<p>The difference is that power users see the web as a series of spaces. Not just any spaces, but navigational spaces. What is a navigational space? It’s a space in which you can move from one area to another. If you consider yourself a power user then this might sound pretty self-explanatory right? Of course we move from page to page, flipping through tabs and going from window to window. Doesn’t everybody?</p>


<p>When was the last time you had to write down specific instructions on how to walk to the closest depanneur (convenience store) or other nearby space within walking distance? Was it the last time they cut down that bush by the stop sign? No? Well how about when they painted that house on the corner a different color? Nope. Me neither, and I’d be willing to bet my mother didn’t need to either. Not that we’re hanging around your house or anything-</p>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/navigationalAwareness/whereami.png" title="image" alt="images"></p>

<p>The point is that our brains understand three-dimensional space well enough to get us from point A to point B without us having to worry about minor changes along the way. Almost every town you go to has roads of some kind along with physical structures and landmarks, and it’s usually from a combination of all of these things that our brains can hack out some form of situational awareness so that we don’t get totally lost or stuck if something changes around us.</p>


<p>To some extent, our minds can also do this in our two dimensional internet world. Almost every website you visit (note how we “visit” websites and tell somebody to “go” to google) has links, colored squares and icons. Most of us power users have become pretty adept at swinging from page to page without having to worry about how to get from A to B since our minds are more experienced in two dimensional navigation and landmarking. Non-power users on the other hand don’t navigate through websites, they look for a small tunnel to shoot for and try to ignore all the other noise coming from the website rather than set up a mental</p>


<p>I believe designers could use a stronger system of navigational techniques to encourage all users (not just non-power users) to actually navigate their websites instead of blindly following a prescribed set of steps on “how to” do x on y.com. Navigational layouts should never change so drastically as to confuse habitual users and should instead gradually introduce new elements and routes. Different routes through a site should never be hidden to a user and never be nested so deeply as to lose a user in the annals of the site (If I have to click settings inside the setting tab, there’s something wrong there). Icons, images and other web landmarks should be unambiguous, distinct and should always accompany lists.</p>


<p>These are some uninformed suggestions on how to make the web a more accessible place. If I had more time I’d actually do some hard research into the topic of how our brains process navigational space. It’s all really interesting stuff that I’m sure we’ll learn about more in the future. But hey, by then there might not be any non-power users left in the world. Even still, I think designing memorable and navigable websites is the essence of solid user experience and satisfaction.</p>
